 -This Project is one of the useful device used in the world, A parking sensor for all the drivers out there who keep denting their car while parking it in reverse.
 
 -I have modified the code I saw on the internet by Dejan Nedelkovski. 
 
 -I have added a LCD screen, LED and a peizospeaker to this device, which could also help any impaired driver by making high pitch sound and flashing the LED.
 
 -This code uses the library liquidcrystal.h which is used for displaying our message on our 16x2 LCD dislpay.
