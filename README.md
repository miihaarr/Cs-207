``` ARDUINO : Reverse Car parking Sensor ```
 This Project is one of the useful device used in the world, A parking sensor for all the drivers out there who keep denting their car while parking it in reverse.
 I have modified the code I saw on the internet by Dejan Nedelkovski. 
 I have added a LCD screen, LED and a peizospeaker to this device, which could also help any impaired driver by making high pitch sound and flashing the LED.
 This code uses the library liquidcrystal.h which is used for displaying our message on our 16x2 LCD dislpay.
 Here is my code, and a picture of my Arduino project irl and schematic diagram.
